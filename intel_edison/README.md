I won 2nd place at the 2016 Intel travelling "road show" hackathon when they came to Denver.

Water Cloud is a lawn sprinkler interrupt system, designed to work with existing "dumb" sprinkler systems
by interrupting solenoid activity to engage sprinkler heads if rain was predicted or existing soil moisture
was already at a threshold, to reduce water use/expense.
